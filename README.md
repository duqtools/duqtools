# Duqtools

*Duqtools* is a tool for **D**ynamic **U**ncertainty **Q**uantification for Tokamak reactor simulations modelling.

Features:

- Set up 100s of simulation runs from a single template
- Launch standard sets of sensitivity tests with minimal programming
- Batch job submission and status tracking
- Supports the Standardized Interface Data Structures (IDSs) data directory
- Compare and visualize 100s of simulations in one overview
- Display simulation results as confidence ranges and distributions

*Duqtools* is currently under active development. It runs on linux only and requires the [ITER](http://iter.org/) Integrated Modeling and Analysis Suite ([IMAS](https://confluence.iter.org/display/IMP)).

To install:

```console
pip install duqtools
```

Or to use on the gateway:

```console
module use /gss_efgw_work/work/g2vazizi/duqtools/modules
module load duqtools/3.1.4
```

The source code is available from [Github](https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools).

Suggestions, improvements, and edits are most welcome.
