# Example directory

This directory contains an example of how to run `duqtools`

## Config

The config is stored in `config.yaml`.

It defines which directory to use as a template, and which variables to update for the UQ runs.

## Create

`duqtools create -c config.yaml`

This reads the config and sets up the directory structure for the UQ runs.
