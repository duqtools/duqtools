## Getting started with develoment

### Setup

*Duqtools* targets Python 3.7, which is the version available on [eufus](https://wiki.eufus.eu/doku.php).

Clone the repository into the `duqtools` directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/CarbonCollective/fusion-dUQtools.git duqtools
```

Install using `virtualenv`:

```console
cd duqtools
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e .[develop]
```

Alternatively, install using Conda:

```console
cd duqtools
conda create -n duqtools python=3.7
conda activate duqtools
pip install -e .[develop]
```

### Running tests

Duqtools uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) to run the tests. You can run the tests for yourself using:

```console
pytest
```

### Building the documentation

The documentation uses the [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). To build the docs for yourself:

```console
pip install -e .[docs]
mkdocs serve
```

### Making a release

The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

1. Bump the version (`major`/`minor`/`patch` as needed)

```console
bumpversion minor
```

2. Make a new [release](https://github.com/CarbonCollective/fusion-dUQtools/releases). The [upload to pypi](https://github.com/CarbonCollective/fusion-dUQtools/actions/workflows/publish.yaml) is triggered when a release is published.
